# KNN Classification
In this project the dataset provided has hidden feature column names but the data and the target classes are specified.
So by using KNN we will try to directly predict the class for the new data point based on the features.

Also, as the KNN classifier predicts the class of a given test observation by identifying the observations that are nearest to it, the scale of the variables matters. 
Any variables that are on a large scale will have a much larger effect on the distance between the observations, and hence we will be scaling the features too.

Apart from that we will iterate over different values of K to find the best suited value and lastly will complete the model with that value of K.
